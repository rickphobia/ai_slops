## The test tuning table: small, round numbers so a test can play a whole crop in a few calls.
## Cotton ripens in 30 seconds, so each of the three growing stages lasts 10. A Shift lasts
## 100 seconds, the first Quota is 3 picks and rises by 2 each Shift, and a pick earns 5
## Labour Points. A missed Quota's first Study Session lasts 20 seconds and each one in a row
## doubles, capped at 50: 20, 40, 50, 50. On the Generator a lap takes 10 seconds and the
## Worker runs 10 laps (100 seconds, longer than a crop takes) before he stops to breathe;
## 3 seconds later the Overseer whistles, and 2 seconds after that he whips and the Worker runs.
## Offline, crops grow at half speed (60 seconds offline to ripen) and one return counts at
## most 1000 seconds. Each Withered plot docks 8 Labour Points, and Negligence starts an
## 80-second Study Session, longer than the 50-second cap for missed Quotas.
## In table() ripe cotton takes far longer to Wither than any test plays, so tests about other
## rules never meet it; withering_table() makes it Wither after 50 seconds.
## In table() work adds no Exhaustion and its floor never rises, so tests about other rules
## never meet it; exhausting_table() makes each plant and pick add 10 and each lap 1, and
## raises the floor by 5 each Shift. Above 50 a field action takes 2 seconds; above 80 a pick
## drops its cotton half the time. Laps before a breath fall from 10 at no Exhaustion to 2 at
## 100 (6 at 50). A rest hour costs 10 Labour Points and lasts 20 seconds, taking away 40
## Exhaustion (2 a second); an hour offline takes away 36 (0.01 a second).
## The Generator has two Upgrade tiers: the first costs 10 Labour Points (two picks), doubles
## growth per second of running and raises the Quota by 1; the second costs 20, triples growth
## and raises the Quota by 2 more.
## The tools have two tiers: the first costs 10, halves a slow pick's time and the drop chance
## (a 1-second pick, a 1-in-4 drop) and raises the Quota by 1; the second costs 20, leaves a
## quarter of each and raises the Quota by 2 more.
