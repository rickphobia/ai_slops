# Asset credits

Every file in `assets/` is listed here with its author, licence and where it came from. All are CC0 (public domain), so crediting is not required, but we do it anyway. Add a row before adding an asset; only CC0 assets go in this folder.

The plant and fence colours are replaced in code (`src/adapters/field/`) with the field's muted palette; the Worker keeps the model's own colours. The model files are unchanged; the two BigSoundBank sounds were cut from the site's MP3s with ffmpeg as described. The Generator and its loudspeaker pole are simple shapes built in code (`src/adapters/field/generator.gd`), not an asset, and so are the power tiles and the lap line (`src/adapters/field/power_tiles.gd`). So is the Overseer's whip (`src/adapters/field/overseer_look.gd`), and the Generator's whine is a hum made in code (`src/adapters/audio/field_sounds.gd`).
