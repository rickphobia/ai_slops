# 31: Harmony Audits

**What to build:** Now and then The App announces a Harmony Audit at the Hand-in. It is likelier the more the Worker kept back over the last few Shifts, compared with what his Plots should yield, and spending hidden savings in the state's store raises the chance a little. Before an audit the Overseer watches the scale. A cut above the tolerance catches him: his hidden savings are taken, he serves the longest Study Session yet, and he is put on watch, when audits come more often and any cut is found. A second catch sends its own message for the story and endings spec to build on (land and hazards spec: stories 36–37, 39, 42–55, 99–100, 102–103, 105; "Implementation Decisions": Audits).

**Blocked by:** 30 (Keeping back and hidden savings)

**Status:** ready

**Touches:** rules, config/tuning, content/app-text, content/sources, adapters/app-overlay, adapters/field, adapters/save, adapters/debug

**Effort:** medium

- [ ] At the start of each Shift after the first, an audit is rolled: base chance, plus kept share times a factor, plus hidden savings spent in the store times a small factor, at most 1, multiplied while on watch
- [ ] Paying Bills from hidden savings doesn't raise the chance
- [ ] The rules remember the last few Shifts (tuning, 3 to start): kept, should-have-yielded, and savings spent in the store
- [ ] With an audit planned, the Overseer stands at a scale by the gate for the last part of the Shift
- [ ] At the Hand-in the audit finds nothing below the tolerance (cheered by The App) and catches him above it; on watch, any cut is caught
- [ ] Caught: all hidden savings taken, the caught Study Session (longer than Negligence's, and the only one if the Quota was also missed), on watch for a set number of Shifts, and the catch count up; a second catch sends its own message
- [ ] The App shows being on watch and the Shifts left as "Harmony Support"; being caught is paperwork, never violence
- [ ] All the numbers come from the tuning table, with validation
- [ ] A planned audit, the remembered Shifts, on watch and the catch count are saved
- [ ] Debug mode adds "Audit this Shift"
- [ ] Audits planned (chance) and their result (kept share, tolerance), and catches, are logged
- [ ] Whether audits of pickers or penalties for keeping cotton back are documented is checked; if not, they are not presented as fact and the Sources page doesn't cite them
- [ ] GUT tests through Farm cover the chance, the tell, the result, being caught, on watch and save round trips
