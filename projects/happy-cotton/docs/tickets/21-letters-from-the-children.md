# 21: Letters from the Children

**What to build:** Every few Shifts a letter arrives from the Worker's Children, shown as a handwritten page that looks nothing like The App. A letters box keeps them to re-read. Over the series their tone slowly changes, from warm and homesick to distant and full of school slogans. When school fees go unpaid the letters stop; they start again once Debt is cleared, and letters that would have come in between are lost. The Children are never shown or described being punished (economy spec: stories 44–50, 52, 59; "Implementation Decisions": Letters, Family text, Sources register; "Content rules for this spec").

**Blocked by:** 20 (School fees)

**Status:** ready

**Touches:** rules, config/tuning, content/family-text, content/sources, adapters/letters, adapters/save

**Effort:** medium

- [ ] The rules emit a "letter arrived" Family event (letter id) at the start of every Nth Shift (tuning), separate from App messages
- [ ] The letter is chosen by how many letter Shifts have passed, so letters missed while stopped are skipped; when the list runs out, no new letters come
- [ ] Letters stop while school fees are unpaid and start again when Debt reaches zero
- [ ] A Family text table holds each letter: id, which Child, text, and source ids where a line makes a factual claim; the Children's names and ages are decided here
- [ ] zenz-2019 is checked for what the change in tone draws on; lines it doesn't support are written as the Child's own experience, not as claims
- [ ] A content test fails if a letter the rules can emit has no text or cites a source id not in the register
- [ ] A letter opens as a handwritten page (CC0 font, credited) and the letters box lists received letters in order
- [ ] Letters received, the letter Shift count and the stopped state are saved; a save without them restores with none
- [ ] Letters stopping and starting are logged, never their text
- [ ] GUT tests through Farm cover arrival, stopping, starting again and skipping
- [ ] Works in the web export on a phone-sized screen (record what was checked in the PR)
