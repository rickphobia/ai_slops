class_name Farm
extends RefCounted
## The Farm rules: the plots and the cotton growing in them. No scene tree, clock or file
## access: time only moves when advance() or resume_offline() is called, so tests play hours
## in milliseconds.
## It also runs the Shift: online play counts it down, and at its end the Quota is checked and
## the next Shift starts at once with a higher Quota. What The App should say comes out as
## AppMessages through take_messages(). A missed Quota starts a Study Session: the Worker can't
## plant or pick until it ends, and the next Shift's clock waits for it.
## The Worker is either in the field or on the Generator (see Toil). Crops grow only while he
## runs on it; after a set number of laps he stops to breathe and growth halts until the
## Overseer whistles, then whips, and he runs again (advance() returns these events).
## Planting or picking brings him back to the field, and so does a Study Session.
## Offline time (the game closed or its tab hidden) grows crops at a slower rate with no
## Generator and serves the Study Session, but the Shift waits. Ripe cotton left unpicked too
## long, counted outside Study Sessions, Withers; each Withered plot is Negligence, which docks
## Labour Points and starts a Study Session longer than a missed Quota's.
## Work wears the Worker down (see Exhaustion): above one threshold his field work is slow,
## above a higher one a pick can drop its cotton, and he runs fewer laps before he stops to
## breathe. Labour Points buy a rest hour, which takes him off the Generator and lowers
## Exhaustion towards a floor that rises every Shift. A missed Quota takes the rest hour away
## for the next Shift. Offline time recovers Exhaustion slowly, never below the floor.
## The store (see Store) sells Upgrades tier by tier: a Generator tier makes each second of
## running grow more cotton at once, and a tools tier makes a slow pick shorter and an
## exhausted one less likely to drop its cotton; each raises the Quota from the next Shift on.
## Every Shift ends with the Bills (see Ledger), met Quota or missed: electricity for each lap
## run that Shift, then rent, shown as a pay slip. A Bill the Labour Points can't cover becomes
## Debt, which earnings pay down first; while it lasts no Privilege or Upgrade can be bought.
## A missed Quota takes away every Privilege for the next Shift.
## to_save() gives the whole Farm as plain data and restore() takes it back, so a restored Farm
## plays on exactly as the saved one would have.
