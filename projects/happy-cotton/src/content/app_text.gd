extends RefCounted
## The App's words: the text for each message key the rules emit, the overlay's labels, and
## the state's doublespeak terms. All of it is the state's cheerful voice, never the Worker's.
## A line that uses a doublespeak term or makes a claim cites its source by id from the
## sources register; tests/content/test_app_text.gd fails if one doesn't.

## The state's vocabulary, each term mapped to the source that documents it.
## Where in the source, so a reader can check it:
## - Poverty Alleviation: zenz-2020, Executive Summary: cotton picking "plays a key role in
##   achieving the state's poverty alleviation targets. These targets are mainly achieved
##   through coercive labor transfers."
