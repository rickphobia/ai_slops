class_name WorkerMotion
extends RefCounted
## Moves the Worker model to match what the rules say he is doing. Sent to the Generator, he
## walks out through the fence's gate to the lap line and runs laps of the track, keeping in
## step with the rules' lap clock so he crosses the lap line as each lap ends. He slows on his
## last lap, staggers and stands bent over on the lap line to breathe, and goes back along the
## track and through the gate to his place beside the plots when he is sent to the field or to
## rest. As Exhaustion rises he slumps forward and his walk slows. When the Overseer whips him
## he flinches and staggers where he stands, then runs on. Only the Worker's own walk, run,
## stagger and idle animations are used; never a fighting one.

## Emitted each time a foot strikes the track as he runs or walks on it, with where it
## landed, for the footstep sound and the power tile under it.
