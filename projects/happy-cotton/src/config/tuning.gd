## The one table of game numbers. Rules and adapters read their numbers from here,
## never from literals. Every field starts as NAN, so a table that leaves one out
## is caught as "missing" instead of silently using a default.
## A ticket that adds a rule adds its numbers here, to LIMITS, and to data/tuning.tres.

## Allowed range per field, inclusive: [lowest, highest].

## Labour Points earned for each pick.
@export var labour_points_per_pick: float = NAN
## How long the first Study Session after a met Quota lasts, in seconds of real time. Each
## one in a row lasts twice as long as the last.
@export var study_session_seconds: float = NAN
## The longest a Study Session can last, however many come in a row. At least
## study_session_seconds.
@export var study_session_cap_seconds: float = NAN
## How long one lap of the track round the fence takes, in seconds of online play. The field
## shows him running at the pace this sets over the track's length (about 52 m as shipped).
@export var lap_seconds: float = NAN
## How many laps the Worker runs on the Generator before he stops to breathe. Leaving the
## Generator doesn't rest him: the laps since his last breath carry over.
@export var laps_before_breath: float = NAN
## How long he stands bent over on the Generator, breathing, before the Overseer blows his
## whistle. Crops halt meanwhile.

## How long after the whistle the Overseer uses the whip, and the Worker runs again.
@export var whip_after_seconds: float = NAN
## How fast crops grow while the game is closed or its tab hidden (the night shift), as a share
## of how fast they grow while the Worker runs on the Generator. No Generator is needed.
@export var offline_growth_rate: float = NAN
## The most offline time one return counts, in seconds. More is cut to this, so one bad
## timestamp can't move the Farm on by years.
@export var offline_cap_seconds: float = NAN
## How long ripe cotton can wait to be picked before it Withers, in seconds counted outside
## Study Sessions, online or offline.
@export var wither_seconds: float = NAN
## Labour Points docked for each Withered plot. The balance never goes below zero.
@export var negligence_labour_points: float = NAN
## How long the Study Session for Negligence lasts. It must be longer than the cap for a missed
## Quota, so Negligence is always punished more severely.

@export var exhaustion_per_plant: float = NAN
## Exhaustion added by each pick, even one that drops its cotton.

## Above this Exhaustion a plant, pick or clear takes slow_action_seconds, and the Worker can do
## nothing else in the field until it is done. At or below it they are instant.

## How long a plant, pick or clear takes above slow_exhaustion, in seconds of online play.
@export var slow_action_seconds: float = NAN
## Above this Exhaustion a pick can drop its cotton. At least slow_exhaustion.
@export var mistake_exhaustion: float = NAN
## The chance, from 0 to 1, that a pick above mistake_exhaustion drops its cotton: the plot is
## emptied but nothing counts towards the Quota and no Labour Points are earned.
@export var dropped_cotton_chance: float = NAN
## How much the Exhaustion floor rises at the end of every Shift. Rest never goes below the
## floor, and it never falls.
@export var exhaustion_floor_rise: float = NAN
## How many laps he runs before he stops to breathe when fully exhausted. Between this and
## laps_before_breath (at no Exhaustion) it falls in step with Exhaustion, set at the start of
## each run. At most laps_before_breath.
@export var fewest_laps_before_breath: float = NAN
## Labour Points a rest hour costs.
@export var rest_hour_price: float = NAN
## How long a rest hour lasts, in seconds of online play. It is the state's name for it, not a
## real hour. The Shift keeps counting and crops halt, as he is off the Generator.
@export var rest_hour_seconds: float = NAN
## How much Exhaustion a whole rest hour takes away, a little at a time, never below the floor.
@export var rest_hour_recovery: float = NAN
## How much Exhaustion an hour away from the game takes away, never below the floor.
@export var offline_recovery_per_hour: float = NAN
