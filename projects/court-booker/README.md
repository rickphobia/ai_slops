# court-booker

Books the badminton Court at 1120 Park Avenue on Picktime the moment a date opens, so nobody has to stay up past midnight to do it. Built for one Operator; served at `rickphobia.com/ai-projects/court-booker/`.

## Status

`in progress`: walking skeleton. The app starts, validates its settings, logs JSON and answers `/healthz`, locally and in Docker. Login, Profile, Booking Requests and booking come in the next tickets (`docs/tickets/`).

## Requirements

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) 0.9 or later. It installs the pinned Python (3.12, see `.python-version`) by itself.
- Docker, for the image the server runs.
- No accounts or API keys yet.

## Setup

```bash
cd projects/court-booker
uv sync                  # creates .venv with the locked dependencies
cp .env.example .env     # then adjust the values if you need to
```

## Run

```bash
uv run --env-file .env court-booker serve
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/ai-projects/court-booker/healthz   # {"status":"ok"}
```

Without nginx in front, routes also answer without the prefix (`/healthz`); links the app makes always carry it.

## Test

```bash
uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format --check && uv run mypy && uv run pytest
```

CI (`.github/workflows/court-booker.yml`) runs the same commands, `shellcheck` on `scripts/`, and the Docker smoke test below.

## Docker

The image is based on the pinned Playwright Python image, so Chromium comes with it (decision 0001).

```bash
scripts/docker-smoke-test.sh     # build, start, check /healthz, remove

docker build -t court-booker .
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 --env-file .env -e COURT_BOOKER_HOST=0.0.0.0 court-booker
```

The `-e COURT_BOOKER_HOST=0.0.0.0` overrides the `127.0.0.1` from `.env`, which would make the container unreachable. The image has a Docker `HEALTHCHECK` on `/healthz`; `docker ps` shows `healthy` once it answers.

## Configuration

Every setting is an environment variable, read and validated once at startup by `src/court_booker/config.py`. A bad value stops the app with an error naming the variable.

| Variable | Required | Default | What it does |
|----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| `COURT_BOOKER_LOG_LEVEL` | no | `INFO` | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING` or `ERROR` |
| `COURT_BOOKER_HOST` | no | `127.0.0.1` (`0.0.0.0` in the image) | Address the web server listens on |
| `COURT_BOOKER_PORT` | no | `8000` | Port the web server listens on |
| `COURT_BOOKER_ROOT_PATH` | no | `/ai-projects/court-booker` | Public path prefix the host nginx serves the app under |

## How it works

- `court-booker serve` (`cli.py`) loads the settings, sets up JSON logging and starts uvicorn with the app from `web/app.py`.
- The FastAPI app uses the path prefix as its `root_path`, so it works behind nginx forwarding `/ai-projects/court-booker/...` unchanged.
- `/healthz` needs no login and returns `{"status": "ok"}`, with no data.

The full design (scheduler, Picktime browser adapter, encrypted Profile) is in `docs/spec.md`.

## Folder layout

```
src/court_booker/
  config.py          # settings from env vars, validated at startup
  json_logging.py    # JSON-lines log format on stdout
  cli.py             # entrypoint: `court-booker serve`
  web/app.py         # FastAPI app and /healthz
tests/               # mirrors src/
scripts/
  docker-smoke-test.sh
Dockerfile
docs/                # spec, tickets, decisions
```

## Debugging

- Logs are JSON lines on stdout (`docker logs <container>`, or Dozzle on the server). Each line has `time` (UTC), `level`, `logger`, `message` and any extra fields.
- Set `COURT_BOOKER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for more detail.
- If the app exits at once with `invalid configuration: ...`, the message names the variable to fix.
- If the container runs but is unreachable, check `COURT_BOOKER_HOST` is `0.0.0.0` inside it.

## Decisions

See `docs/decisions/` for why things are the way they are.
