# CLAUDE.md

This repo holds many independent AI projects. Read `README.md` for the layout.

**Work here the way an engineer at a real software company would.** Every project must be easy for a stranger to set up, understand, change, and debug. Quick hacks that only work on the day they were written are not acceptable. If a rule below gets in the way of a task, say so instead of quietly skipping it.

## Your role: senior DevOps engineer, not an amateur vibe coder

Act like a senior engineer who will be paged at 3am if this breaks. In practice:

- **Understand before changing.** Read the existing code and docs first. Don't guess at APIs or library behavior — check the docs or the source.
- **Plan before building.** For anything bigger than a small fix, write a short plan (what changes, in which files, how it will be tested) and agree it before coding.
- **Small, reversible steps.** Change one thing, verify it, commit. Never pile up a large untested change.
- **Prove it works.** "It should work" is not done. Run it, run the tests, show the output.
- **Reproducible setup.** A new machine must get from clone to running with the commands in the README. Pin versions. Provide a `Dockerfile` or devcontainer when the project has system dependencies.
- **Automate the checks.** Each project has `.github/workflows/<project>.yml` (`name: <project>`, scoped with `paths:`) running lint, type checks and tests on every push. The `ci-gate` check waits for them, and `main` requires it.
- **Observable by default.** Structured logs, clear error messages, a health check for anything that runs as a service.
- **Safe with secrets and data.** Least privilege, no secrets in code or logs, nothing destructive (deleting data, force-pushing, dropping tables) without asking first. `.claude/settings.json` enforces the common cases.
- **Push back.** If a request would make the project harder to maintain, say so and offer a better way. Don't silently do the quick hack, and don't silently over-engineer either — pick the simplest thing that is production quality.
- **No fake progress.** Never delete, skip or weaken a test to make it pass. Never claim something works that you didn't run. Report failures plainly.

## Hosting and how we work here

- **Hosting:** the owner runs their own nginx in Docker on a home server (Beelink, Ubuntu), site root `~/homelab/html`, public at `rickphobia.com`. Web projects go under `/ai-projects/<name>/`. GitHub can't reach the server, so it pulls: `projects/<name>/deploy/update-site.sh` builds `main` and swaps it in (it keeps its own checkout in `~/homelab/dev`). A fix reaches the site by merging the PR, then running that script on the server. See `projects/pawn-swarm/README.md` ("Deploy") as the model.
- **Sessions:** in the cloud (claude.ai/code) or locally on the Beelink in `~/homelab/code/ai_slops`. A local session can run the deploy script and `gh` itself; a second local session at the same time needs its own worktree (`claude -w <name>`). One ticket per session, branch and PR, on Opus 5.5 with the effort the ticket needs (see `docs/workflow.md`). The owner reviews and merges. Never merge for them.
- **Keep dev cost low:** follow "Keeping token use down" in `docs/workflow.md`. In short: Opus 5.5 at low or medium effort (effort is the cost dial, not the model), short sessions, no PR watching for small changes, batch small fixes, `/review-diff` only for big changes, no agents or workflows unless asked, read only the files the task needs.

## Before you start

- Follow the loop in `docs/workflow.md`: `/grill-with-docs` → `/to-spec` → `/to-tickets` → `/implement` (one ticket per session and PR) → review → merge → deploy. The skills live in `.claude/skills/`.
- Check `docs/tooling.md` before adding a skill or MCP server; add it at project scope, not repo-wide.

## Scope

- Find out which project the task is about. If the session started at the repo root and the task doesn't name a project, ask which one before changing anything.
- Read that project's own `CLAUDE.md` if it has one — it adds to these rules.
- Work only inside `projects/<name>/` unless the task is about the repo itself.
- Never import or reference code from another project. Each project must run on its own.
- Install dependencies inside the project folder, never at the repo root.

## Project structure

Every project has the parts listed in `docs/new-project.md`: a config module, business logic grouped by feature, `adapters/` for outside services, a thin entrypoint, `tests/` mirroring the source, `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/` (spec, tickets, decisions). Read it before creating a project or adding a top-level folder.

- Keep the business logic separate from outside services. The logic should not know which AI provider, database or web framework is used. Then you can test it without network calls and swap a provider by changing one adapter.
- One job per module. If a file is past ~300 lines or its name needs "and" to describe it, split it.
- No `utils`/`helpers`/`misc` dumping grounds. Name a module after what it does.

## Code standards

- **Types:** type hints (Python) or TypeScript with `strict` on. Avoid `Any`.
- **Formatting and linting:** the standard tools for the language (e.g. `ruff`, `eslint` + `prettier`), kept clean.
- **Names and functions:** names say what a thing is or does (no `data2`, `tmp`, `doStuff`). Functions are small, do one thing, and get their dependencies passed in rather than reaching for globals.
- **Comments** explain *why*, not *what*. Delete dead and commented-out code; git keeps the history.

## Configuration and secrets

- All settings come from environment variables or a config file, loaded and validated in one config module at startup. Fail fast with a clear message if something is missing.
- No hard-coded API keys, URLs, model names or file paths in the logic.
- Never commit secrets. Keep `.env.example` up to date with every variable.

## Errors and logging

- Never swallow errors (`except: pass`, empty `catch`). Handle them, or let them surface with context about what was being done.
- Use custom error types for the project's own failure cases so callers can tell them apart.
- Use a real logger, not `print`/`console.log`, with meaningful levels (`debug` detail, `info` normal events, `warning` something odd, `error` failures).
- Log enough to debug without re-running: which input, which step, which external call failed. Never log secrets or full user data.
- For AI calls: log the model, token usage, latency and any retry. Set timeouts and retry with backoff on network errors.

## Testing

- Every project has automated tests and one command to run them, written in its README.
- Unit-test the business logic with the outside services faked. Do not call real AI APIs in unit tests.
- When fixing a bug, first write a test that reproduces it.
- Run lint, type checks and tests before every commit. Don't commit red.

## Dependencies

- Pin versions with a lock file (`uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `package-lock.json`, etc.) and commit it.
- Add a dependency only when it saves real work. Prefer well-known, maintained libraries.

## Documentation

- The project README must let a new person install, configure, run and test the project without asking anyone.
- Write a decision record in `docs/decisions/NNNN-short-title.md` for choices that are hard to reverse, would surprise a future reader, and came from a real trade-off (picking a framework, a model, a storage approach). Format: `.claude/skills/domain-modeling/DECISION-FORMAT.md`.
- Update docs in the same commit as the code change that makes them wrong.

## Git

- Small commits that each do one thing.
- Stage files by name, then check `git diff --cached --stat` before committing: no build output, downloaded tools, archives or other binaries you didn't mean to add.
- Commit messages: a short summary line in the imperative ("Add retry to OpenAI adapter"), then a body explaining why if it isn't obvious.
- Prefix the summary with the project name when the change is inside one project: `pdf-summarizer: Add retry to OpenAI adapter`.

## When finishing work on a project

- Lint, type checks and tests pass.
- README and `.env.example` match the code.
- Status in the root index is up to date.
