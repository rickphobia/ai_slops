# Tooling: skills, plugins and MCP servers

Researched 2026-10-01 from GitHub and official docs. Reddit and YouTube were blocked from the research environment, so community opinion comes from Hacker News, blogs and talk transcripts. Star counts are approximate.

**Rule of thumb: install the fewest tools that do the job, per project.** Every skill and MCP server costs context. One test of 47 marketplace skills found most made output worse. Add tools at project scope (`projects/<name>/.mcp.json`), not repo-wide, unless every project needs them.

**Desktop vs cloud:** tools marked 🖥️ connect to a running desktop app (Blender, Unity, Unreal, Godot editor). They only work when Claude Code runs on your own machine, not in a claude.ai/code cloud session.

## Every project

| Tool | What it does | Install |
|------|--------------|---------|
| [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) | Feeds Claude current, version-correct library docs. Stops invented APIs. | `claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp` |
| Official `code-review` / `pr-review-toolkit` plugins | Multi-agent review of a diff or PR | `/plugin install code-review@claude-plugins-official` |
| Official LSP plugin for the language (`pyright-lsp`, `typescript-lsp`, ...) | Real go-to-definition and type errors | `/plugin install pyright-lsp@claude-plugins-official` |
| `security-guidance` plugin | Warns on risky edits | `/plugin install security-guidance@claude-plugins-official` |
| [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) — **already in `.claude/skills/`**, adapted to this repo | Grill → spec → tickets → TDD → review workflow | Nothing to install. Don't also add Superpowers: two workflow packs fight each other |

Optional: [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) for web UIs, [GitHub MCP](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) with `--toolsets` limited.

Skipped: Sequential Thinking (built-in thinking covers it), Serena (its own docs report Claude Code ignoring its tools), big mixed marketplaces (context bloat).

## Game dev

| Tool | What it does | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| [Godot AI](https://github.com/hi-godot/godot-ai) 🖥️ | 46 tools inside the Godot 4.7+ editor | Editor plugin generates the `claude mcp add` command |
| [Coding-Solo/godot-mcp](https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp) | Run projects, read debug output, edit scenes | Works headless — usable in the cloud if Godot is installed |
| [CoplayDev/unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp) 🖥️ | Unity scenes, assets, C# with validation | Largest Unity community |
| Epic's built-in Unreal MCP (UE 5.8) 🖥️ | First-party, experimental | No documented auth |
| [ChiR24/Unreal_mcp](https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp) 🖥️ | Mature third-party Unreal option, UE 5.0–5.8 | Token-gated |

## Blender / 3D

| Tool | What it does | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| [MCP for Blender](https://github.com/ahujasid/mcp-for-blender) 🖥️ | Control Blender, fetch Poly Haven/Sketchfab assets | ~30k stars. ⚠️ Runs **unsandboxed Python** with full disk/network access. Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`. |
| [blenderwright](https://github.com/HoldMyBeer-gg/blenderwright) 🖥️ | 186 tools, sandboxed Python | Safer, smaller community |

## Game assets (all cloud, paid API keys)

| Tool | What it does | Install |
|------|--------------|---------|
| [fal MCP](https://fal.ai/docs/documentation/setting-up/mcp) | 1,000+ models: images, sprites, textures, audio, 3D | `claude mcp add --transport http fal-ai https://mcp.fal.ai/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer $FAL_KEY"` |
| [ElevenLabs MCP](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/eleven-agents/operate/hosted-mcp) | Voice, sound effects, music | `claude mcp add --transport http elevenlabs https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/mcp` (the old local repo is archived) |
| [pixel-plugin](https://github.com/willibrandon/pixel-plugin) | Pixel art via Aseprite | Needs Aseprite installed |

## Machine learning and data

| Tool | What it does | Install |
|------|--------------|---------|
| [Hugging Face MCP](https://github.com/huggingface/hf-mcp-server) + [HF skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills) | Search models/datasets/papers, run Spaces, fine-tuning skills | `claude mcp add hf -t http "https://huggingface.co/mcp?login"`; `/plugin marketplace add huggingface/skills` |
| [Jupyter MCP](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server) | Run code in a live notebook kernel and read outputs | Only if you need a live kernel; Claude can already edit `.ipynb` files |
| [W&B MCP](https://github.com/wandb/wandb-mcp-server) **or** MLflow's `mlflow mcp run` | Query experiment runs and metrics | Whichever tracker the project uses |
| [DuckDB/MotherDuck MCP](https://github.com/motherduckdb/mcp-server-motherduck) | SQL over local files, read-only by default | `uvx mcp-server-motherduck` |
| [arXiv MCP](https://github.com/blazickjp/arxiv-mcp-server) | Search and read papers, no key | `claude mcp add arxiv -- uvx arxiv-mcp-server` |
| Kaggle official hosted MCP | Datasets, competitions, notebooks | Docs at kaggle.com/docs/mcp (not verified) |

No official Modal MCP exists; use the Modal skills in [AI-Research-SKILLs](https://github.com/Orchestra-Research/AI-Research-SKILLs) if needed.

## Sharing config through the repo

- **MCP servers:** `claude mcp add --scope project ...` writes `.mcp.json`. Commit it. Put secrets in env vars as `${VAR}`, never in the file.
- **Skills:** `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, committed. Works per project folder too.
- **Plugins:** `enabledPlugins` in `.claude/settings.json`. ⚠️ Cloud sessions (claude.ai/code) do **not** load plugins from this file; `.mcp.json` and `.claude/skills/` do work there.
